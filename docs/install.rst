Installation
============
This software can be installed in multiple ways the ways that are recommended are as follows.

I would recommend using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_ personally but any of the following ways should work.

To install simply run::

    $ pip install delorean

or if you must `easy_install <http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html>`_ ::

    $ easy_install delorean

If you have a copy of the source simply running the following from the root directory should have the same effect::

    $ python setup.py install
